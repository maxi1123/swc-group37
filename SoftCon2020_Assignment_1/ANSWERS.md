Part 1.1

** Refer to swc-group37\SoftCon2020_Assignment_1\Assignment_1 1.1.pdf for the drawing **

We started with the class "Locales" in the package "com.kotcrab.vis.ui",
as we felt it was a good starting point to get a basic understanding of the architecture.
The class uses a solid amount of import statements and it relies on a lot of other packages,
which gave us a foundation to draw our abstraction. We decided to visualize the architecture
by using boxes and arrows. The boxes representing the packages were given black borders, while we
used blue borders for the classes.
An incoming arrow indicates an import statement used by the respective class, while as an outgoing arrow indicates,
that the class is being imported elsewhere.
