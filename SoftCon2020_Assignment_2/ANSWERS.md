#Task 1
Start the Code via AirportShuttle.Main. 
One input requirement: If the user types in only one string it will wait for him to type in the second one before it checks validity.
We decided to construct our code like this because it should be common understanding by the user and us that we need two strings for a coordinate on the grid.

#Task 2
Look up UML Diagram.png for the UML Diagram.
