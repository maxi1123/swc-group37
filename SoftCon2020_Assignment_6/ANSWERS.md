#Exercise 1
----------------
For the Exercise 1, the Model, View, and Controller classes
have been implemented in the respective classes. As visible in the UML,
there is no inheritance or implementation between these classes, only relations. 
Because the Controller handles the View and Model, there is no direct link between those two classes.

#Exercise 2
----------------
The Responsibilities of the customer classes are naturally the most logical ones. A customer
object must be able to set the price of a product, login / logout, add and remove products from the cart, 
as well as buy the products which rest in the shopping cart. The search bar is responsible for filtering, while
the Shopping Cart class is responsible for handling payment options / logic.
All the mentioned functionalities are depicted in the UML diagram.
