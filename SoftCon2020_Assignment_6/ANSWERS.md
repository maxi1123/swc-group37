#Exercise 1
----------------
For the Exercise 1, the Model, View, and Controller classes
have been implemented in the respective classes. As visible in the UML,
there is no inheritance or implementation between these classes,
 only relations. Because the Controller handles the View and Model, there
 is no direct link between those two classes.
